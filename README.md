# sudoku-android
This is my solution to the final assignment of IINI4001 - Application Development for Android.   
The app comes with three different difficulties (easy, medium and hard) for 9x9 sudoku.   
There is one board per difficulty by default, and users can manually create new boards from within the app. (No auto generation of boards)   
   
The project was made using [Android Studio 4.0.1](https://developer.android.com/studio).
